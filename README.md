# M5_based_sensing-unit
Sensing unit based on the M5 Stack core2 monitoring air quality with the BME68

Connect the BME68 sensor to the I2C to start reading the values straight away.

You can use the WiFi manager to connect to the WiFi and then use the addresss to updload new code via OTA.

Very basic at the moment.
